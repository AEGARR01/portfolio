    <h2 style="color:red;">About Me</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was a kid I always found myself drawn to computers. Technology has always been something that I have found interesting and without it, I do not think I would be where I am today. I have met so many friends through the internet and online sources such as video games. Many of these friendships have started online but made their way to real life. In one instance, I met one of my friends that I had known for many years through Playstation in real life when I took a trip to New York City a few years back. It is relationships like theses that began my coding journey, showing me the beauty of the internet and what it can do for people. I do not think I would enjoy coding at all if it weren't for the joy that the internet has brought me. I began learning to code 4 years ago but my progess came to a hault after just one year. This is due to the COVID pandemic and not being able to get the real instruction I needed in order to fully comprehend coding. A year after the COVID pandemic hit, I was back in school learning to code all over again as if I had never learned to begin with. I didn't let this setback stop me from wanting to code though, instead I used it as feul and began to work even harder to become better than I was before. Besides coding, I am interested in things like sports (preferably football), going to the gym and lifitng, and running. I was born in Louisville, Kentucky where I have lived my entire life. This is kind of a step back in my opinion for coders because unlike many places on the west coast, there are not as many coding opportunities and people are not as interested in the subject as a whole. This has not stopped me from trying to learn as much as I can though. I believe that coding is a great gateway into many things that I am interested in and can be applied to all of my intrest, whether that be something simple such as calculating a 1 RM (1 rep max) or something complicated such as designing a football game that you can play. These are projects that I have not currently made but I plan on doing in the future as my skills as a coder improve. </p>

    <h3 style="color:red;">My Old Coding Projects</h3>

    <p>This is one of my first projects I ever worked on during my time in the computer science program at Fern Creek Highschool. It is a way to decode and enconde something using the ceaser cypher and although it had some errors in it, it ultimately still worked. At the time, I was proud of it because it was the first real computer science project I had ever worked on by myself but now, this kind of thing is very simple to me. </p2> 

        <h4 style="color:red;">My New Coding Projects</h4>
        <img src="newercodingexample.png">
        <p>This is an example of something that I have worked on recently during my senior year in the computer science program at Fern Creek Highschool. It takes information from a website and allows the user to sort through the data and find the coldest and hottest days in a certain place. During this project, I was able to learn many things and it was the first time that I had used data other people created rather than my own data. In the first coding project I put up, there were errors in the code, but this time there are no errors and the program works as intended. It shows how I have evolved as a coder and learned from my mistakes as time has gone by.  </p>
