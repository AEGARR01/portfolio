    <h2 style="color:red;">About Me</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was a kid I always found myself drawn to computers. Technology has always been something that I have found interesting and without it, I do not think I would be where I am today. I have met so many friends through the internet and online sources such as video games. Many of these friendships have started online but made their way to real life. In one instance, I met one of my friends that I had known for many years through Playstation in real life when I took a trip to New York City a few years back. It is relationships like theses that began my coding journey, showing me the beauty of the internet and what it can do for people. I do not think I would enjoy coding at all if it weren't for the joy that the internet has brought me. I began learning to code 4 years ago but my progess came to a hault after just one year. This is due to the COVID pandemic and not being able to get the real instruction I needed in order to fully comprehend coding. A year after the COVID pandemic hit, I was back in school learning to code all over again as if I had never learned to begin with. I didn't let this setback stop me from wanting to code though, instead I used it as feul and began to work even harder to become better than I was before. Besides coding, I am interested in things like sports (preferably football), going to the gym and lifitng and running. I was born in Louisville, Kentucky where I have lived my entire life. This is kind of a step back in my opinion for coders because unlike many places on the west coast, there are not as many coding opportunities and people are not as interested in the subject as a whole. This has not stopped me from trying to learn as much as I can though.  </p>
